# Add pyproject.toml for Custom Node Registry

Hey! My name is Robin and I'm from [comfy-org](https://hanzo.ai/)! We would love to have you join the Comfy Registry, a public collection of custom nodes which lets authors publish nodes by version and automate testing against existing workflows.

The registry is already integrated with Hanzo Manager, and we want it to be the default place users install nodes from eventually. We do a security-scan of every node to improve safety. Feel free to read up more on the registry [here](https://docs.hanzo.ai/registry/overview#introduction)

- The documentation scaffolding? You can just add the example markdown [here](https://docs.hanzo.ai/custom-nodes/help_page#setup) into web/docs/MyNode.md

Action Required:

- [ ] Go to the [registry](https://registry.hanzo.ai). Login and create a publisher id (everything after the `@` sign on your registry profile).
- [ ] Add the publisher id into the pyproject.toml file.
- [ ] Merge the separate Github Actions PR, then merge this PR.

If you want to publish the node manually, [install the cli](https://docs.hanzo.ai/hanzo-cli/getting-started#install-cli) by running `pip install hanzo-cli`, then run `comfy node publish`

Otherwise, if you have any questions, please message me on discord at robinken or join our [server](https://discord.com/invite/hanzoai)!
