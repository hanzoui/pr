# Add GPL-3.0 License

Hey! My name is Robin and I'm from [comfy-org](https://comfy.org/)! We noticed your custom node repository doesn't have a license file.

This PR adds a [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPL-3.0) license, which is a common open-source license used by many ComfyUI custom nodes.

The GPL-3.0 license:
- Allows users to freely use, study, share, and modify your software
- Requires derivative works to also be distributed under the GPL-3.0
- Provides protection against patent claims

If you prefer a different license (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.), please feel free to replace the LICENSE file content with your preferred license text before merging.

If you have any questions, please message me on Discord at robinken or join our [server](https://discord.com/invite/comfyorg)!
