## Comfy-PR Project Goals

The Comfy-PR project aims to support and streamline the process for Custom Node Authors to publish their work in the hanzo registry. Here's why this initiative is essential:

1. **Simplify Node Publishing**: Provide tools and assistance to make publishing Custom Nodes straightforward, allowing authors to concentrate on development rather than the complexities of the publishing process.
2. **Expand Node Availability**: Streamlined publishing will increase the number of Custom Nodes in the hanzo registry, enriching the ecosystem and offering more options to users.
3. **Encourage Collaboration**: Scanning GitHub repositories and providing follow-up support fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and a stronger sense of community among Custom Node Authors and users.
4. **Ensure Quality and Compliance**: Automate checks and provide guidance to maintain high-quality standards and compliance within the hanzo registry.
5. **Resolve Publishing Issues Promptly**: Address Custom Node Authors' issues during the publishing process quickly, reducing frustration and improving the overall user experience.
6. **Strengthen the Comfy Community**: Help solve users' problems with Custom Node uploading and publishing, contributing to a more vibrant, supportive, and engaged community.
7. **Promote Innovation**: Lower barriers to publishing Custom Nodes to encourage innovation and creativity within the community, leading to the development of novel and exciting nodes.

Through these efforts, Comfy-PR seeks to create an environment where Custom Node Authors can thrive and users can access a diverse and high-quality array of Custom Nodes.

bun install

# Start MongoDB (required for dashboard)
docker compose up mongodb -d

# Initialize database
bun src/index.ts

# Development modes:
bun run dev          # Web dashboard (http://localhost:3000)
bun run dev:tsc      # TypeScript compiler watch mode
bun run gh-service   # Webhook service

# Testing
bun test             # Run test suite
bun test --watch     # Watch mode

# Linting and building
bun run lint         # ESLint
bun run build        # Next.js build
```

### Running Individual Components

```bash
# Process specific repositories
bun src/cli.ts https://github.com/example/repo

# Run specific tasks
bun app/tasks/coreping/coreping.ts
bun app/tasks/gh-bounty/gh-bounty.ts

# Update repository data
bun src/updateCNRepos.ts
bun src/updateAuthors.ts
```

## Advanced Usage

### Webhook Integration

For real-time GitHub event monitoring:

```bash
# Generate secure webhook secret
export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Enable webhook mode
export USE_WEBHOOKS=true
export WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Start webhook service
bun run gh-service
```

See [WEBHOOK_SETUP.md](./WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) for detailed webhook configuration.

### Task System

The platform includes several automated tasks:

- **CorePing** (`app/tasks/coreping/`): Repository health monitoring
- **GitHub Bounty** (`app/tasks/gh-bounty/`): Bounty management
- **Design Tasks** (`app/tasks/gh-design/`): Design-related automation
- **Contributor Analysis** (`app/tasks/github-contributor-analyze/`): Contribution statistics
- **Action Updates** (`app/tasks/github-action-update/`): GitHub Actions maintenance

### Database Inspection

```bash
# Inspect production database (read-only)
echo 'MONGODB_URI_INSPECT=mongodb://prod-readonly-uri' > .env.development.local
echo 'MONGODB_URI=$MONGODB_URI_INSPECT' >> .env.development.local

# Run inspection scripts
bun src/checkPRsFailures.ts
bun src/analyzeTotals.ts
```

### Performance Optimization

The project uses a cached GitHub API client (`src/ghc.ts`) that:

- Stores responses in SQLite for 5 minutes
- Reduces API rate limiting
- Improves response times for repeated requests

```typescript
import { ghc } from "./src/ghc";

// Use ghc instead of gh for automatic caching
const repo = await ghc.repos.get({ owner, repo });
```
