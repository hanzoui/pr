# GitHub Issue Search

Search issues and PRs across all Comfy-Org repositories:
prbot github-issue search --query "<search terms>" [--limit=5]

Examples:
prbot github-issue search --query "authentication bug" --limit 5
prbot github-issue search --query "dark mode feature"

Best practices:

- Search for known bugs or feature requests before starting work.
- Reference issue numbers in your responses.
- Link to relevant discussions and PRs.
