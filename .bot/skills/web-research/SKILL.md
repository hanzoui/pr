# Web Research and Citation

When external information is needed:

- Prefer official docs, READMEs, CHANGELOGs, and issues/PRs.
- Cross-check dates and versions; prefer recent sources.
- Provide short quotes and links with clear attribution.
- Use prbot github-issue search for searching GitHub issues.
